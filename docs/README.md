# AoPS Desktop
This is the Alpha test version of AoPS Desktop. Two popular userscripts (AoPS Enhanced and AoPS Master Script), native Darkmode (thanks to Darkreader), and all sorts of other awesome things are built right into it! If it doesn't look right, has a bug, or anything else is weird (like a missing page), let us know on the [Issues page](https://github.com/darkwater4213/aops-desktop/issues/new)! (Discussions, a bona fide desktop Alpha build, and other goodies coming soon.) <!---- If you have an idea or feature request, let us know in Discusions. ---->

## Warnings
- This is NOT an official AoPS application! It is made and maintained solely by AoPS users who have volunteered to develop this.
- This is NOT stable! - It is the Alpha version of the AoPS Desktop Application, deployed on GitHub Pages. It is still in active development. Do NOT try to log in to your AoPS account yet! (Or create one, for that matter). If you have any questions, comments, ideas, or would like to help, open a [new Issue](https://github.com/darkwater4213/aops-desktop/issues/new). 
- We are not liable for any loss of data, credentials, or any other form of private information. Use at your own peril!

[I have read all warnings, and agree to report any bugs found on this site, if any.](https://github.com/darkwater4213/aops-desktop/blob/pages-deploy/README.md)

<!---- # What is AoPS Desktop?
AoPS desktop is a volunteer-led, user-made platform for Art of Problem Solving. Except that it has a completely revamped homepage, better (customizable!) GUI, and all sorts of other goodies. The original site can be found at [AoPS.com](https://artofproblemsolving.com) ---->
