# AoPS Desktop
This is the Alpha test version of AoPS Desktop. <!-- Two popular userscripts (AoPS Enhanced and AoPS Master Script), native darkmode (thanks to a pruned-down version of [Darkreader](https://github.com/darkreader/darkreader)), and all sorts of other awesome things are built right into it! --> If it doesn't look right, has a bug, or anything else is weird (like a missing page), let us know on the [Issues page](https://github.com/darkwater4213/aops-desktop/issues/new)! (Discussions, a bona fide desktop Alpha build, and other goodies coming soon.)  

## Warnings
- This is NOT an official AoPS application! It is made and maintained solely by AoPS users who have volunteered to develop this.
- This is NOT stable! - It is the Alpha version of the AoPS Desktop Application, deployed on GitHub Pages. It is still in active development. Do NOT try to log in to your AoPS account yet! (Or create one, for that matter). If you have any questions, comments, ideas, or would like to help, open a [new Issue](https://github.com/darkwater4213/aops-desktop/issues/new). Do NOT post on Site Support! AoPS Desktop is not affiliated with AoPS Incorporated, and chances are, they will have no idea what you are talking about. Make sure that the bug is with the AoPS platform and not the client before posting a bug report on Site Support. If it is the client that has the problem, file an Issue here (on GitHub). <!-- Or contact one of us directly at... -->

<!-- # What is AoPS Desktop?  
AoPS desktop is a volunteer-led, user-made platform for Art of Problem Solving. Except that it has a completely revamped homepage, better (customizable!) GUI, and all sorts of other cool stuff. The original site can be found at [AoPS.com](https://artofproblemsolving.com) -->  

## Stand-in Roadmap (More future projects coming soon)
- We hope to eventually add a `*.<type>.aops` file extension to the desktop build that you can open in the desktop application. That way, you can save TeXeR docs offline as `name.texer.aops` and open them using the native desktop application. The application would open the contents in the TeXeR and auto-render it as MathJaX. Maybe we could eventually add a sub-sub extension that looks something like `name.bbcode.texer.aops` or `name.pdf.texer.aops` or... You get the idea. Point is, the sub-sub extension would direct the application to render it using the specified method. Another possibility is to have the protocols and rendering method stored in the file's metadata. This poses the problem of the rendering method being hard to change. (In Explorer on Windows, you have to select the file, click on properties, go to Details, and scroll down until you find the relevant information. Editing it is even harder, as it tends to corrupt the rest of the metadata. The whole process is even worse on Mac) Of course, the file-extension system also has the problem of being confusing to newcomers, but is much easier to view and change. An example for a TeXeR file is available at `~\docs\equations.texer.aops`. You can open it using the GitHub web interface [here](https://github.com/darkwater4213/aops-desktop/blob/main/docs/equations.texer.aops). You can also open it in Notepad on Windows. It should just be some equations in LaTeX and plaintext. More examples coming soon!
