# AoPS Desktop (Pages ALPHA) -- PLEASE READ
This is the Alpha test version of AoPS Desktop. If it doesn't look right, has a bug, or anything else is weird (like a missing page), let us know on the [Issues page](https://github.com/darkwater4213/aops-desktop/issues/new)! (Discussions, a bona fide desktop Alpha build, and other goodies coming soon.)

# _WARNING!!!_
This is NOT an official AoPS application! This is maade and amintained solely by AoPS users who have volunteered to help develop this. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

# _ANOTHER WARNING!_
This is NOT STABLE! This is the Alpha version of the AoPS Desktop Application, deployed on GitHub Pages. This is still in active development, and is most likely extremely buggy.

If you have any questions, comments, ideas, or would like to help, open a [new Issue](https://github.com/darkwater4213/aops-desktop/issues/new).

<!---- # What is AoPS Desktop?
AoPS desktop is a volunteer-led, user-made platform for Art of Problem Solving. Except that it has a completely revamped homepage, better (customizable!) GUI, and all sorts of other goodies. The original site can be found at [AoPS.com](https://artofproblemsolving.com) ---->
